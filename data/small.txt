my name is john.
what is your favorite color?
yellow

listen i know you hate having to sit home because i'm not susie high school.
like you care.
i do care. but i'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else ' s .
i wish i had that luxury. i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i ca n't go because you won ' t.
joey never told you we went out did he \?
what \?
in 9th. for a month
why \?
he was like a total babe
but you hate joey
now i do. back then was a different story.
as in ...
he said everyone was doing it. so i did it.
you did what \?
just once. afterwards i told him i did n't want to anymore. i was n't ready. he got pissed. then he broke up with me.
but
after that i swore i 'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it. and i have n't since. except for bogey 's party and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
why did n't you tell me \?
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
no. you did n't ! if you really thought i could make my own decisions you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage.
that 's not
i'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
i guess i thought i was protecting you.
god you 're just like him ! just keep me locked away in the dark so i ca n't experience anything for myself
not all experiences are good bianca. you ca n't always trust the people you want to.
